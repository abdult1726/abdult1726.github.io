This week my class got to take a test. The test included some questions that were easy for most and other questions that the class struggled with. The test was mostly for us to see how skilled we are at identifying different types of code and defining them, from strings and numbers to checks and contracts.I found the test rather easy while i was taking it, but i still didn't get to finish it on time, so i have to wait for my next opporotunity. One the questions in this test was to find the name of the outermost function in scale(2, circle(40, "solid", "blue")). The answer to this question was scale. the other choices were circle, rectangle, and contract, which I know are not right because none of those are functions. This was one of the easy questions for the class since 75.5% of the class got the questions right.
