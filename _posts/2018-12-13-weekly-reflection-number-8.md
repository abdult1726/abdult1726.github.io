For the past few weeks we have been working on making flags for countries that we were assigned. At first we had to make a collage of our assigned flag using scrap paper, scissors, glue and a ruler. I was able to make the union jack for the Australian flag, but i didnt get to make the stars. After that we got to decide what flag we wanted to code, so decided on the British flag since i already made a collage for it with the union jack part of the Australian flag. Right now i only have part of the flag done. The collage part a found pointless, but now i get to code it so i can enjoy that.
