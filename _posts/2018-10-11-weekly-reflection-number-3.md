This week in APCSS, we worked on Pyrat some more. This week we focused on making simple shapes and then using those shapes and putting 
them together to make more complex shapes. We did this by first trying to make flags. This is what i liked the least, which was having to 
find the exact measurment of each shape on the flag so they were as accurate to the real flag as possible.
