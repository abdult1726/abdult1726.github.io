This week we continued to learn more about using Pyret. We learned about different types of data called quantitative and categorial data, and then using that date to organize and identify tables. Then we learned how to actually make those tables with a name for each column and adding what belonged in each row. We then learned that we can take the tables we made and make them into pie and bar charts. Finally, we learned that we can borrow the data from another source and put it into pyret to avoit alot of work. I found it interesting and thought this would be useful in the future when trying to organize data.
