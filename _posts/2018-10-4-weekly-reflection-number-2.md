This week I learned about a new coding language called pyret. Pyret is a coding language very similar to one called WeScheme that 
I did last year. With it, i learned about the markup data needed to make shapes with pyret. We also learned about the origin of Pyret
WeScheme and coding since it began. It's an interesting language.
