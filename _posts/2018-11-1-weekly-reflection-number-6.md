title: 6th week of coding

This week in class, we had to focus more on understanding contracts. We learned how to write contracts for any kind of function and how to make functions out of contracts. We also learned how to make checks, which make sure that the functions that we make will successfully produce something. Contracts are made up of three parts, which are the name, the name of the function, the domain, the code required to produced something, and the range, which is what is actually produced from the domain. We learned to point out differences between code so we always whats a number, a string, an image and a boolean. This week was basically focusing on many details that we need to produce functions correctly. I found this helpful since the info learned will prevent me from making mistakes when coding, and know how to fix it if i do make a mistake.
